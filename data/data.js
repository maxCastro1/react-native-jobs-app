Our composable data and analytics platform provides a single source of truth across organizations and to their customers.\n\nTo this day, we've helped more than 140,000 world’s top businesses deliver on their analytics goals and scale their data use cases - from self-service and embeddable analytics to machine learning and IoT.\n\nYou can find more information at https://www.gooddata.com/ .\nProfessional Services Team at GoodData\n\nOur mission is to deliver customer solutions built on our GoodData platform. We are using an agile and creative approach to build a fully-functioning customer solution fast and adjust it based on the customer's feedback.\n\nWe are a team of 30 people including project managers, architects, solution/backend/frontend engineers, and UX designers. We cooperate closely together in multiple projects and drive the whole solution including analyzing, planning, and implementation. In the team, we help each other, share knowledge, and are open to learning new things.\n\nOur team is located in Prague, and we enjoy meeting people in person. We also support flexible working hours and working from home. Our colleagues at GoodData are multinational, so communication in English is recommended.\nFrontend Engineers in Professional Services\n\nOur solutions are trusted by some of the world’s top companies in the e-commerce and financial services industry. Our frontend implementation, in cooperation with a powerful backend layer, helps integrate analytics directly into customer software products, applications, or web portals.\n\nWe use our GoodData.UI library to embed and customize an analytics interface or even design and develop a solution that pulls data from custom logic formed in the analytics while avoiding that “traditional analytics” look!\n\nTech stacks: JavaScript/TypeScript, React, SVG, Jest Enzyme, Storybook Backstop\n\nIf you don't have much experience with some of these tools - no problem! Our colleagues are here to share knowledge and support you. We also encourage our teams to propose new ideas and come up with their own solutions and tech stack suggestions for the projects.\n\nYou can find more information on our embedded analytics page.\n\nAbout GoodData.UI\n\nGoodData.UI is a TypeScript framework for building analytical applications on top of the GoodData platform or GoodData.CN. The library is open-source and owned by our colleagues in the Engineering Frontend team.\n\nYou can play with some code samples in your browser using our interactive examples, or find more information on the GoodData.UI web page and in our example gallery.\n\nTech stacks: TypeScript, React Redux Redux-Saga, Jest Enzyme, Storybook Backstop, Cypress, and Rush as a build system.\n\nWhat We Can Offer You as a Frontend Developer\n• We use JavaScript/TypeScript. Our frontend solutions are built with React, and our code is stored on GitHub. We do code reviews for all changes, which allows us to share knowledge and maintain code quality. Our code is deployed to development, test and production environments via a robust and automated CI connected to GitHub.\n• You can choose a MacBook or a Lenovo Linux machine, and we let you pick your favorite development environment (most people use Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA). We use Jira and Confluence to manage projects and documents.\n• We have regular meetups to share knowledge, learn new technologies, and socialize and have fun within the Professional Services team and the whole GoodData frontend community. We have company-wide hackathons, offsites, and conferences. We also maintain our work-life balance with the GoodLife activities such as sport, cultural events, and pubs :)\n\nWhat You Will Do\n• Collaborate on customer solutions built on the GoodData platform.\n• Implement features and applications in an agile environment, with the cooperation and active communication within an autonomous team.\n• Be involved in and contribute to feature implementation and technical architecture design in cooperation with engineers, technical leads, and architects.\n• Perform code reviews, write unit tests, and collaborate with QA teams to deliver high-quality products.\n• Learn new technologies and engage in automated deployment and continuous delivery processes.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n• Frontend development skills with 2 years of experience with JavaScript/TypeScript and experience with React.\n• An understanding of software development methodologies and Git workflows.\n• Hacking mentality in a fast development cycle.\n• Enthusiasm to learn and go beyond your boundaries.\n• Being a team player.\n• Good English communication skills.\n\nNice-to-Have Qualifications\n• Experience in software testing, code documentation, and a Unix development environment.\n• Experience with SVG, Express, webpack, Parcel, and Redux with Redux-Saga.\n• An understanding of how APIs work (REST APIs, HTTP errors, rate limiting, authentication, and so on).",

We are inviting you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable. You would help us deliver new features, explore different ways of problem solving, and discover, explain, and defend your choices in implementation.\n\nAt Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don’t have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. Some of the ways that we accomplish that include paired programming to tackle a hard problem, transparent code reviews, and discussions about design and architecture. Since Crunch’s employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused. We move fast but carefully, with an earnest commitment to not breaking things… well, not too much.\n\nOn the front-end team, we feel strongly about developing solutions that are both technically and aesthetically sound. We invite you to bring your experience and perspective to conversations about the future growth of our applications and environment. We work closely together, with a healthy and non-combative review process aimed at improving code as well as developing each other’s skills. In short, we strive to write solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code; and we are seeking a new member of our already highly-effective team.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n• Work on new features with other front-end team members.\n• Triage, unravel, test, and resolve bugs and issues.\n• Update existing code in parallel with backend changes to ensure uninterrupted operation.\n• Review your colleagues’ work on pull requests.\n• Propose, discuss, and debate technology improvements, code organization, design patterns, and conventions employed in the front-end development environment.\n• Use your extensive experience to train and mentor other developers on the front-end team.\n\nOur stack\n\nFront-end developers on our platform are first-class team members. Although your focus is primarily on TypeScript, you will gain familiarity with the entire system. Some of the technologies that enable us to achieve our well-designed, efficient, and performant applications are:\n• TypeScript (latest specification)\n• Webpack + Babel (ES6 modules)\n• React + Redux\n• Styled Components\n• Unit testing with Jest (we have over 5500 unit tests across our app)\n• Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment\n\nIf you have experience or interest in these additional areas, you may have the opportunity to work with them as part of your role:\n• End-to-end testing using cypress\n• Responsive design / mobile / touch interfaces\n\nBasic qualifications\n• Advanced to expert-level React skills with demonstrated experience.\n• A firm command of Typescript.\n• Familiarity with JavaScript frameworks and libraries for building web applications.\n• Commitment to high development standards, including comprehensive testing.\n• Demonstrated ability to work with team of peers, understanding and respecting the responsibilities and expertise that developers, designers, QA staff, and others bring to the project.\n• Ability to provide reasonable estimates on work, meet deadlines, and take ownership and responsibility.\n• Well-developed principles of self-motivation and time management.\n• An appetite for continual improvement and growth.\n\nAdvanced (preferred) qualifications\n• Bachelor’s Degree in Programming, Computer Science, or Engineering-related field.\n• Current or former contributor to a significant open-source React library.",
